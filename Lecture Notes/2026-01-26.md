## Recursion

Like we talked about in the last lecture, we can solve a multiplication problem by breaking up a problem in a recursion tree. We can break up a problem with many digits into multiple problems with 1 digit. Unfortunatly this algorithm was no better than our grade school algorithm.

Given that we have 4^t problems of size n/2^t, we can see that as the number of digits get smaller, the number of problems get larger. This continues until we have 1 digit. This gives up n^2 problems of size 1.

```
n(1/2)^t = 1
(1/2)^t = 1/n
2^-t = 1/n
2^t = n
log2(n) = t

  4^(log2(n)) = (2^2)^log2(n)
= 2^(2log2(n)) = 2^(log2(n^2))
= n^2
```

Another way to see this:
```
T(n) = 4 * T(n/2) + (about n to add stuff up, ignore for now)

T(n) = 4 * (4 * T(n/4))         ----- 4^2 * T(n/2^2)
     = 4 * (4 * (4 * T(n/8)))   ----- 4^3 * T(n/2^3)
     .
     .
     .
     2^2t * T(n/2^t)            ----- 4^t * T(n/2^t)
     .
     .
     .
     n^2 * T(1)
```

### Karatsuba

We can make this better. Karatsuba figured out how to make divide and conquer a little better.

```
xy = (a * 10^n/2 + b)(c * 10^n/2 + d)
(a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd
```
*assuming addition is cheaper than multiplication*

Recursively computer these THREE things:
- ac
- bd
- (a + b)(c + d)

We can then reassemble xy, including cross terms to get our multiplication

Example in psudeo code:
```
Mult(x,y):
    if n = 1:
        return xy
    write x = a10^n/2 + b and y = c10^n/2 + d
    ac = Mult(a, c)
    bd = Mult(b, d)
    z = Mult(a + b, c + d)
    crossTerms = z - ac - bd
    xy = ac10^n + (crossTerms) 10^n/2 + bd
    return xy
```
- the quanity of cross terms is meant to be (ad + bc)
- a + b and c + d can be computed in O(n)
- like with our previous method, this still assumes n is a power of 2

```
3^log2n = n^log2(3) = n^1.6
```

### Wrap Up

This method is much faster than O(n^2), but can we do better?

- Toom-Cook (1963) - O(n^1.465)
- Schonahage-Strassen (1971) - O(nlog(n)loglog(n))
- Furer (2007) - nlog(n) x 2^(O(log*(n)))

(*the star is not multiplication in this case*)
