## Master Theorem

### Technicalities II

- If $n$ is odd, I can't break it up into two problems of size $n/2$.

```math
T(n) = T([\frac{n}{2}]) + T([\frac{n}{2}]) + O(n)
```
- However (see CLRS, Section 4.6.2), one can show that the Master theorem works fine if you pretend that what you have is:
```math
T(n) = 2 \cdot T(\frac{n}{2}) ...
```
---

$T(n) = a \cdot T(\frac{n}{b}) + O(n^d)$

---

#### Needlessly recrusive int mult.
```math
T(n) = 4T(\frac{n}{2}) + O(n) \\
T(n) = O(n^2)
```

- a = 4
- b = 2
- d = 1

$a > b^d$

---

#### Karatsuba int mult.
```math
T(n) = 3T(\frac{n}{2}) + O(n) \\
T(n) = O(n^{log(2)} = n^{1.6})
```

- a = 3
- b = 2
- d = 1

$a > b^d$

---

#### MergeSort
```math
T(n) = 2T(\frac{n}{2}) + O(n) \\
T(n) = O(nlog(n))
```

- a = 2
- b = 2
- d = 1

$a > b^d$

---

#### That other one
```math
T(n) = T(\frac{n}{2}) + O(n) \\
T(n) = O(n)
```

- a = 1
- b = 2
- d = 1

$a > b^d$

### Proof of the master theorem

> **NOTE:** We are assuming the base case is $T(1) = c$ for convenience.

- We'll do the same recrusion tree thing we did for MergeSort, but be more careful.
- Suppose that $T(n) = a \cdot T(\frac{n}{b}) + c \cdot n^d$.
    - At level $log_b(n)$ would have $a^{log_b(n)}$ problems, a size of 1 per problem, and we would have $a^{log_b(n)}c$ work at this level.

$\sum a^tc(\frac{n}{b^t})^d$

Total work is at most:

$cn^d \sum (\frac{a^t}{b^{td}}) = cn^d \sum (\frac{a}{b^d})^t$

## Substitution Method

- Another way to solve recurrence relations
- Suppose $T(n) \le c \cdot f(n) + \sum{T(n_i)}$
